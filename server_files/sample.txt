This is a sample text file for testing the file sharing application.

You can download this file from the server to test the download functionality.
You can also modify this file and upload it back to test the upload functionality.

The file transfer uses:
- Low-level file operations (open, read, write, close)
- Socket programming (send, recv)
- Simple XOR encryption for demonstration

This demonstrates Linux System Programming concepts in action!
